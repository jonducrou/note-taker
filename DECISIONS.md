- **Alternative Considered**: Traditional form-based UI (rejected as too complex)

### **Inline Metadata with `@tags`** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Keeps structure visible and editable within content
- **Format**: `@group:Product @audience:Sarah,DevTeam`
- **Benefit**: No separate fields to fill, visible in exported text
- **Alternative Considered**: Separate metadata fields (rejected as disruptive)

### **Click-to-Complete Interactions** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Makes static text interactive without complex UI
- **Implementation**: Click `[]` to toggle `[x]`, click `->` to toggle `-x>`
- **Rationale**: Natural interaction model, visual feedback
- **Alternative Considered**: Keyboard shortcuts only (rejected as less discoverable)

## üîß Technical Implementation Decisions

### **Custom Monaco Language ('notes')** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Enables syntax highlighting and intelligent autocompletion
- **Features**: Colour-coded actions, connections, metadata
- **Benefit**: Visual distinction without UI complexity
- **Alternative Considered**: Plain markdown (rejected due to limited highlighting)

### **IPC Communication Pattern** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Clean separation between UI and file operations
- **Implementation**: Electron IPC with typed handlers
- **Benefit**: Type safety, testable storage layer
- **Alternative Considered**: Direct file access from renderer (rejected for security)

### **Auto-save with Debouncing** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Never lose work without performance impact
- **Implementation**: 1-second delay after typing stops
- **Rationale**: Balance between safety and performance
- **Alternative Considered**: Manual save (rejected as error-prone)

## üéØ User Experience Decisions

### **Always-on-Top with Auto-Hide** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Available when needed, invisible when not
- **Behaviour**: Show on hotkey, hide on focus loss
- **Rationale**: Reduces context switching while avoiding distraction
- **Alternative Considered**: Normal window (rejected as less accessible)

### **Global Hotkey (Cmd+Shift+N)** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Instant access from any application
- **Choice**: Standard modifier pattern, 'N' for Notes
- **Rationale**: Muscle memory for quick access
- **Alternative Considered**: Menu bar only (rejected as slower)

### **Text Commands (Cmd+K)** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Keyboard-driven navigation without menu complexity
- **Implementation**: Command palette with `/` prefixed commands
- **Benefit**: Fast, discoverable, extensible
- **Alternative Considered**: Traditional menus (rejected as mouse-dependent)

## üìÅ File Organisation Decisions

### **Date-First Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_Group_HHMM.md`** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Chronological sorting while maintaining context grouping
- **Benefit**: Natural ordering, unique names, context visible
- **Rationale**: Time is primary organising principle for meeting notes
- **Alternative Considered**: Group-first naming (rejected due to poor chronological sorting)

### **YAML Frontmatter + Markdown** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Structured metadata with human-readable content
- **Format**: Standard Jekyll/Hugo pattern
- **Benefit**: Parseable by many tools, clean separation
- **Alternative Considered**: JSON metadata (rejected as less readable)

### **~/Documents/Notes Directory** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: User-accessible, standard location, easy backup
- **Rationale**: Users should own their data in familiar location
- **Alternative Considered**: Application data directory (rejected as hidden)

## üéπ Navigation & UX Decisions

### **Keyboard Navigation (Option+Arrows)** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Fast chronological note browsing without conflicting with text editing
- **Implementation**: Option+Down for older notes, Option+Up for newer notes, Option+Left/Right for action navigation
- **Benefit**: Natural timeline navigation without interfering with cursor movement shortcuts
- **Evolution**: Changed from Cmd+arrows in v1.6.2 due to user feedback about typing conflicts
- **Alternative Considered**: Arrow keys only (rejected due to editor conflicts)

### **Dynamic Window Titles** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Provides context without taking screen space
- **Format**: "Tue 26 Aug 14:31" extracted from note IDs
- **Benefit**: Shows note timestamp in both system title and UI header
- **Alternative Considered**: Static "Note Taker" title (rejected as less informative)

### **No Navigation Wrapping** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Predictable boundary behaviour prevents confusion
- **Implementation**: Navigation stops at first/last note
- **Rationale**: Users expect clear start/end points in chronological lists
- **Alternative Considered**: Circular navigation (rejected after user feedback)

## üß™ Testing & Quality Decisions

### **Test-Driven Navigation Development** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Complex navigation logic required upfront verification
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive test suite before UI integration
- **Benefit**: Caught edge cases early, confident feature delivery
- **Alternative Considered**: Manual testing only (rejected as error-prone)

### **Jest + TypeScript Testing** ‚úÖ CHOSEN

- **Benefit**: Prevents regressions, documents expected behaviour
- **Alternative Considered**: No testing framework (rejected for production code)

### **Coverage-Driven Development** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Ensures all critical paths are verified
- **Implementation**: Coverage reports show untested code
- **Target**: Focus on business logic and edge cases
- **Alternative Considered**: Feature testing only (rejected as incomplete)

## üìã Process & Tooling Decisions

### **Simplified GitHub Issue Templates** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Faster issue reporting encourages community engagement
- **Implementation**: Minimal required fields, clear placeholders
- **Rationale**: Simple is fast, essential info only
- **Alternative Considered**: Comprehensive templates (rejected as barriers)

### **Australian English Documentation** ‚úÖ CHOSEN
**Why**: Consistent voice and developer preference
- **Implementation**: "colour" not "color", "realise" not "realize"
- **Benefit**: Authentic communication style
- **Alternative Considered**: US English (rejected for consistency)

## üîÑ What Didn't Work - Lessons Learned

### **Initial Complex UI Approach** ‚ùå REJECTED
**Attempted**: Traditional form-based interface with separate fields
**Problem**: Disrupted writing flow, felt like software not thinking
**Solution**: Pivoted to text-first design with inline metadata

### **First Navigation Implementation** ‚ùå REJECTED
**Attempted**: Initial keyboard navigation with wrapping
**Problem**: User reported confusing direction and unwanted looping
**Solution**: Fixed direction mapping and removed wrap-around behaviour

### **Cmd+Arrow Navigation Shortcuts** ‚ùå REJECTED
**Attempted**: Cmd+Up/Down/Left/Right for note navigation
**Problem**: Conflicted with standard text editing shortcuts (Cmd+Left/Right for cursor to start/end of line)
**Solution**: Changed to Option+arrows in v1.6.2 to preserve normal typing workflow

### **Comprehensive Issue Templates** ‚ùå REJECTED
**Attempted**: Detailed GitHub forms with multiple required fields
**Problem**: Too time-consuming, discourages quick bug reports
**Solution**: Streamlined to essential information only

### **Separate Command Window** ‚ùå REJECTED  
**Attempted**: Dedicated command window for navigation
**Problem**: Added complexity, broke single-window simplicity
**Solution**: Modal command palette overlay

### **Rich Text Formatting** ‚ùå REJECTED
**Attempted**: Bold, italic, colours in text editor
**Problem**: Complexity without clear benefit for note-taking use case  
**Solution**: Focus on structural highlighting (actions, connections)

### **Multiple Window Support** ‚ùå REJECTED
**Attempted**: Allow multiple notes open simultaneously
**Problem**: Violated simplicity principle, increased cognitive load
**Solution**: Single window with fast switching via commands

## üéØ Key Success Factors

### **Ruthless Simplicity**
Every feature decision asked: "Does this make note-taking faster or better?" If not, it was removed or simplified.

### **Text as Primary Interface**
Treating text content as the main interaction surface rather than building complex UI reduced both development time and user cognitive overhead.

### **Performance First**
Optimising for immediate availability (< 1 second from hotkey to typing) shaped all architecture decisions including storage format and UI complexity.

### **User Data Ownership**
Choosing local markdown files over proprietary formats ensures user control and tool longevity.

## üîÆ Future Architecture Considerations

### **Cloud Sync Abstraction** 
Storage interface designed for easy extension to Dropbox, iCloud, or custom sync without UI changes.

### **Plugin Architecture**
Monaco language system and IPC handlers structured to allow future extensions (templates, integrations, export formats).

### **Performance Monitoring**
Built-in telemetry hooks for understanding real-world usage patterns and performance bottlenecks.

### **Cross-Platform Potential**  
Electron foundation enables future Windows/Linux versions with minimal changes to core functionality.
